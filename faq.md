# General Information #
>%!INFO!% <strong id="What">What is MapSurfer.NET?</strong>

MapSurfer.NET is a free, modern and advanced framework for rendering and publishing maps to the web. This framework has a functionality which is very similar to other well-known open source and proprietary software packages such as MapServer, GeoServer, Mapnik or ArcGIS. MapSurfer.NET is written in C# and provides the whole power of the .NET Framework to solve labour-intensive and time-consuming cartographic tasks.

>%!INFO!% <strong id="WhatOS">What platforms are supported by the framework?</strong>

At the moment, MapSurfer.NET can run on Windows and Linux platforms. The support of other operating systems is a high priority task. Thanks to Mono project which makes it potentially possible.

>%!INFO!% <strong id="WhichVersion">Which version should I use?</strong>

It is highly recommended to use the latest stable release of the framework. More detailed information about available [releases](release-notes.md), you can get on Downloads page.

>%!INFO!% <strong id="WhereSampleProjects">Where can one find sample projects with map styles?</strong>

A collection of sample projects is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/MapSurferNET/MapSurfer.NET-Examples).

>%!INFO!% <strong id="CanEmbed">Can I embed the framework into my application?</strong>

Yes, you can. See a [developer guide](devmanual/embedding-msn-in-custom-application.md) about embedding MapSurfer.NET into a custom application.

>%!INFO!% <strong id="PublishWebService">How can I publish a web map service?</strong>

A map can be published through a web map service using either [IIS](usermanual/webservices/running-webservice-using-iis75) or a [self-hosting console application](usermanual/webservices/self-hosting-webservice-nancy). For developers, we recommend to look at [this](https://github.com/MapSurferNET/MapSurfer.NET-Web) github repo.
