MapSurfer.NET is a free, modern and advanced framework for rendering and publishing maps to the web. This framework has a functionality which is very similar to other well-known open source and proprietary software packages such as MapServer, GeoServer, Mapnik or ArcGIS. MapSurfer.NET is written in C# and provides the whole power of the .NET Framework to solve labour-intensive and time-consuming cartographic tasks.
